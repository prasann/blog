[CSS Keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40keyframes) is a powerful feature to create animations in CSS.

Below is a small snippet I created for slider like animation.

See the Pen [Slider](https://codepen.io/prasann/pen/ppNLNL/) by Prasanna ([@prasann](https://codepen.io/prasann)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

Most of the browsers do support keyframes now. [Here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation) is the "Can I Use" page for keyframes.
